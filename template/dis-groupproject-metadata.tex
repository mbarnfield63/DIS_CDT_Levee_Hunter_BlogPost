\DISAbstract{%
    The United States’ National Levee Database (NLD) documents approximately 40,000 km of levees but is known to contain frequent inaccuracies and covers only about one-third of the levees that exist. Accurate levee positioning is critical for Fathom’s flood modelling operations. This project leverages image segmentation techniques to detect levees using elevation data from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) 3D Elevation Program. The developed pipeline enables automated data acquisition, model training and validation, and large-scale inference to identify missing levees and refine the positioning of those already recorded, enhancing the reliability of Fathom’s modelling capabilities.
